Open the Art World
------------------

I really admire the initiative of [Hack the Art World](http://hacktheartworld)
as part of [Digital Revolution](www.barbican.org.uk/digital-revolution/home/).

This is a mirror of the [Hack the Art World](http://hacktheartworld.com)
projects that can be seen anywhere, instead of only at the geocoordinates of the Barbican.

I would love to see Digital Revolution, but I cannot make it to London for the
exhibit.  I am happy to see at least these works.
